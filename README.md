## ⚠️ API Requests & CORS

This project uses a separate frontend and backend hosted on Railway. If you're experiencing errors like:

- `Network Error`
- `blocked:devtools`
- or CORS-related issues in the browser console

Try the following:

- Open in an **Incognito Window**
- **Disable ad blockers** or privacy-related browser extensions

These tools may block cross-service requests even if CORS is configured correctly.
